## How It Works
1- The camera feed is undistorted using a predefined camera matrix and distortion coefficients.

2- ORB features are detected and matched between the live camera feed and the target image.

3- When a sufficient number of matches is found, a homography transformation is applied to overlay the video onto the detected area in the camera feed.
